# Checkers-Desktop-App
C# Object Oriented Programming project that has been created during OOP course at Reichman University with my partner Yuval Frenkel.

We build the Checkers game with tow states - play against another player or against the computer.
While playing against the computer it used an AI Minimax algorithm to choose the best next possible step.
Moreover, you can play with sounds, with or without clues for the next step, and play some games or only single one.
